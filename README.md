# Potentially-Hazardous-Asteroids-Project

This project is intended to independently practice my data science skills with a physics related dataset.
Feedback and questions would be highly appreciated!

I created the columns_descriptions file to hopefully allow bring some insight on the abstract columns labels (such as "e").
